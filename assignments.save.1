Create Task 1
Day 1
 - study for math test (you realize you don't know anything and start cramming)
 - do create task (you made a storyboard and then started playing snake)
Day 2
 it's another day! your math test went okay and now you are ready to work...except, where is your partner? Text her to ask what's going on?
 - yes (she says she is ditching and will be back tomorrow)
   - relax today and work with her tomorrow, it's only an hr and a half anyways (80% on project)
   - work! (your partner comes back and doesn't like what you are doing - 70% on project)
Day 3
 you had a math presentation and had no time to eat your lunch, and against the recommendation by Mr. Whitehouse brought food to your table
 - eat lunch (your drink spills and all of your creat task work is gone. You now owe $200 to school)
 - don't eat lunch (faint on the way home and get sent to hospital. Miss 3 days of school. Jump to Day 6)
Day 6
 your create task is due tomorrow! After an accident, you are finally back to your progress 3 days ago. Your partner is gone again.
 - don't worry about her. Just finish the write-up and turn it in. (Big nono! You did not communicate with your partner to split up your code and you two ended up writing about the same algorithms when they were supposed to be individual developed. 0%!)
 - wait for her to finish her parts and then do write-up. (she never added anything and while waiting, you fell asleep and the deadline passed. 50%)
